Simulation-Enabled Estimation of Kinetic Rates - Version 2
```

## Overview
**Fast** and **versatile** multiscale milestoning to compute molecular 
thermodynamics and kinetics.

Prepare and run milestoning calculations in the OpenMM, NAMD, and/or Browndye2
simulation engines to obtain the kinetics and thermodynamics of molecular 
processes such as: ligand-receptor binding and unbinding, membrane 
permeability, internal molecular dynamics, and many other potential 
situations.

This README is only a quickstart guide to get SEEKR2 up and running as soon as
possible. To see more detailed **instructions** and **tutorials**, please see 
https://seekr2.readthedocs.io/en/latest or the docs/ subfolder.

## Quick Install

### Dependencies
Many of the dependencies for SEEKR2 will be installed alongside SEEKR2, but
some must be installed separately, and are installed first, before SEEKR2.

#### OpenMM (recommended)

OpenMM is recommended for the molecular dynamics (MD) stage of SEEKR2. SEEKR2 
also needs the SEEKR2 OpenMM Plugin in order to use OpenMM for MD simulations.

The easiest, quickest way to install the SEEKR2 OpenMM Plugin is to use
Mamba. If you don't already have Mamba installed, Download Mamba from 
https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh 
and run the downloaded script and fill out the prompts. 

With Mamba working, install the SEEKR2 OpenMM Plugin:

```
mamba install seekr2_openmm_plugin
```
One can test the installation by opening a Python terminal and typing:

```
import seekr2plugin
```

If there is a problem related to not being able to find libOpenMM8.1, one
can try specifying the OpenMM version:

```
mamba install seekr2_openmm_plugin openmm=8.1
```

If there is an error such as "CUDA_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_PTX_VERSION", one can 
see if a different version of CudaToolKit will work:

```
mamba install seekr2_openmm_plugin cudatoolkit=11.7
```

If there is an error such as "No module named seekr2plugin", one can always 
try installing an older version of OpenMM and CUDA:

```
mamba install seekr2_openmm_plugin cudatoolkit=10.2 openmm=7.7
```

Alternatively, NAMD2 may be used for MD if desired. See the NAMD2 section
below for installation instructions.

#### Browndye2 (optional; required for k-on calculations)

SEEKR2 needs Browndye2 if Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations will be run 
(necessary for k-on calculations). Please see (https://browndye.ucsd.edu/) 
for Browndye2 installation instructions.

#### NAMD2 (optional, required if not using OpenMM)

If OpenMM is not desirable or available for the MD simulations, SEEKR2 may 
use NAMD2 in order to run MD simulations. NAMD2 is frequently already 
available on shared computing resources like clusters and supercomputers.
Not all SEEKR2 options may be available using NAMD2.

If you wish to install NAMD2 yourself, please see 
http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/ for instructions to install NAMD.

### Install SEEKR2

Once the dependencies are installed, we may install SEEKR2. First, clone this 
repository and install the package:

```
git clone https://github.com/seekrcentral/seekr2.git
cd seekr2
python -m pip install .
```

### Testing SEEKR2 (Optional)
To test SEEKR2, run the following command in the seekr2/ directory:

```
pytest
```

Additional continuous integration tests may be run from the Python scripts in 
the seekr2/seekr2/continuous_integration/ directory.

## Run

A SEEKR2 calculation needs a "Model Input File" to run. Several examples may
be found in seekr2/seekr2/data. Execute the following commands within the 
seekr2/seekr2/ directory to run a sample calculation on the host-guest system:

(It is assumed that both Browndye2 and the the SEEKR2 OpenMM Plugin have
already been installed).

```
python prepare.py data/sample_input_mmvt_openmm.xml
python run.py any ~/test_mmvt_openmm/model.xml
python converge.py ~/test_mmvt_openmm/model.xml
python analyze.py ~/test_mmvt_openmm/model.xml
```

### Important Options and Hints

* In general, SEEKR2 programs can be run with the '-h' argument to see all
available options. Please see https://seekr2.readthedocs.io/en/latest for a
detailed description of programs and options.

* the **run.py** program accepts an INSTRUCTION as its first argument, and
the following options are available:
  * "any" - run any MD or BD calculation that still needs to be run.
  * "any_md" - run any MD calculation that still needs to be run.
  * "any_bd" - run any BD calculation that still needs to be run.
  * INTEGER - run the MD anchor whose index is INTEGER. Examples: "0", "1", etc.
  * "b_surface" - run BD simulations starting at the b-surface.

* When an option must be modified, it is usually necessary to make the change
in the **input file** and not the **model file**, and then re-run 
prepare.py to make a new model file. In some exceptions, the model file may be
directly (and carefully) modified.
